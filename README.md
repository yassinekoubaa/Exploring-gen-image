# Exploring AI Image Generation: A Hands-On Look at Key Techniques

This repository documents my exploration into various AI techniques for image generation, implemented and explained within a Google Colab notebook. The goal is to understand the underlying principles, compare different model architectures, and demonstrate their capabilities.

## Techniques Covered:

The notebook provides explanations and simplified code examples for:

1.  **Neural Style Transfer (NST):** Transferring artistic styles using pre-trained CNNs.
2.  **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** A DCGAN implementation showcasing adversarial learning for novel image synthesis.
3.  **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** Using probabilistic latent spaces for image reconstruction and generation.
4.  **Diffusion Models:** Featuring Stable Diffusion to demonstrate state-of-the-art text-to-image generation via iterative denoising.

## Key Aspects Explored:

*   **Model Architectures & Mechanisms:** Understanding how NST, GANs, VAEs, and Diffusion Models (including components like U-Nets, text encoders, and VAEs in latent diffusion) fundamentally operate.
*   **Evolution of Generative AI:** Tracing the progression from early feature-based manipulation to complex, high-fidelity generative models.
*   **Comparative Analysis:** Discussing the pros and cons of each technique regarding image quality, training dynamics, and controllability.
*   **Future Directions:** Outlining potential project enhancements and broader research trends in the field.
